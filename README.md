## Your goal: create a functional to-do app

### User stories ⚛️

- User should be able to see the tasks (you have some tasks in the data folder in case they help you)
- User should be able to add a new task to the list
- User should be able to search tasks
- User should be able to delete the tasks they have already finished

### Rules 💡
- There is NOT a "right" way to perform this task, whatever you achieve will be okay
- We are not looking for you to use any particular technique, just do what is clear to you and what works best for you
- You can use the tasks you are given or not
- You can change the tasks and add items to them or change them
- You can add more user stories if you feel like it, but you should try to achieve the given user stories first

> 🕑 Whenever you are told, commit the last changes and deliver the results. Good luck!
